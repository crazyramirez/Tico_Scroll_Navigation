TICO is a BabylonJS Demo using Scroll to navigate in an animation designed in 3DsMax and exported to GLB.
<br>
<br>
Initially thought to make an interactive 3D Visual Portfolio, but as I'm very busy I have left it for the near future.
<br>
<br>
Use mouse scroll or slide touch in mobile to move in the animation.
<br>
Click on the objects to play custom animations.
